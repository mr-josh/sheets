## What's this for?

This little tool was made especially for new programmers who are still building that muscle memory with things such as syntax, terminal commands, terminology, and more. Specifically this has been made with my students in mind (hi kids, I hope your code isn't broken).

By no means is this project as efficient or as tidy as it could be, but it gets the job done.

## How to use this?

TBA.
